Readme for Daniel Rivin's implementation of Bungie's programmer test.

Please view individual readme files within each project folder for specific details on that problem.

I wrote both problems in C# for a few reasons.
1. I like C# and haven't used the language/.NET for over 3 years.  After solving these problems, I have to say I still very much like the language and ease of getting up and started very quickly.
2. C# has some nice built-in libraries includng Regex and String handling, which allowed for less time figuring out libraries and more time solving the core problems.
3. It's plenty fast, and I don't have to deal with messy pointers.

Overall, I really enjoyed solving the problems in this test.  I found myself thinking about the problems and algorithms day and night.  I feel very good about the Boggle problem and feel I came up with a nice, optimal solution.  The markdown problem was (surprisingly to me) more difficult/stressful in that I haven't written a parser/lexer/etc in many years.  I would have liked a bit more time on this problem to come up with a more elegant/extendible solution, but still really enjoyed the time I spent on it.

(Mildly?) Interesting aside
I don't currently have a Windows machine at home (I use a MacBook Pro), but really wanted to use Visual Studio and C#, so I ended up coding all of this on a Windows 10 Preview Virtual Machine (using Oracle's VirtualBox) with Visual Studio 2013 Community.  Amazingly it worked quite well.  The Windows 10 preview Mac hardware drivers weren't perfect, but I was just happy to be in VS2013.  I did test the applications on Windows 7 as well.
